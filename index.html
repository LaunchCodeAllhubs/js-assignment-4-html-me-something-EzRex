               <h2>The Beginning</h2>
               <p>The sound of tiny meows can be heard from a small location next to a tool shed in the back yard of a person's home. There we witness the sighting of a young kitten who looked about 3 to 4 weeks old (definitely &lt 5 weeks) since this little creature still did not know how to retract their claws. This little kitten appeared to be cold and alone, and when she saw a human she would cry and walk towards them.</p>

               <h2>Fostered!</h2>
               <p>Two humans decided to take her in after seeing that the mother cat would not take her back to nurse her. The humans cleaned and fed her, and noticed that the kitten had eye problems; she was swelling on both eyes!</p>

               <p>The small kitten reluctantly agreed to be taken to the shelter where the shelter checked her for anything wrong and started the process for this kitten to be fostered.</p>
